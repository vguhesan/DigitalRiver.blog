      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt; COVID-19 has impacted all of us in some shape or form. The time to rebuild America (and the World) starts today with each and every one of us. It is time to wake the sleeping giant in each and everyone of us and do our part in this RECOVER - REBOOT - REBUILD process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;img &#xA;    &#xA;        src=&#34;https://DigitalRiver.blog/img/2020/04/10/covid-19_2Rs.png&#34; &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;        alt=&#34;COVID-19 : RECOVER, REBOOT, REBUILD&#34;&#xA;    &#xA;     &#xA;        width=&#34;250&#34; &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;     &#xA;        align=&#34;left&#34; &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;        class=&#34;alignleft round-img-border imgframe-right-pad&#34; &#xA;    &#xA;    &gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today, (as I reflect on the pandemic) I am constantly reminded that we are yet to see the peak of this impact; with no end at sight, no light at the end of the tunnel, no reason yet to celebrate. My mind goes through a flood of emotions, thoughts, memories, visuals, events and sounds as I am continuously reminded of the ghostly silent voices of the dead. The casualties of this war where the enemy isn&amp;rsquo;t a faceless soldier from afar but someone very near and close to us. A self-inflicted wound. A child and product of our own upbringing! Our own harvest and reaping! This article is my attempt to capture it all and to find some solace and grace through it all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt; Book Review: The Cartoon Guide To Statistics by Larry Gonick &amp;amp; Woollcott Smith&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;img &#xA;    &#xA;        src=&#34;https://DigitalRiver.blog/img/2019/09/07/Book_TheCartoonGuideToStatistics.jpg&#34; &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;        alt=&#34;Book Review: The Cartoon Guide To Statistics by Larry Gonick &amp;amp; Woollcott Smith&#34;&#xA;    &#xA;     &#xA;        width=&#34;250&#34; &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;     &#xA;        align=&#34;left&#34; &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;        class=&#34;imgframe&#34; &#xA;    &#xA;    &gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with big data over a decade. I&amp;rsquo;ve dealt with system and monitoring solutions that puts out over a million IoT sensor data every few minutes. Streaming them, storing them, analyzing them and finding ways to slice and dice that data has always been interesting to me. And this has built my career the past 15 years. I am constantly trying to find new ways ways to show and represent the data in an UI dashboard and to try to find interesting anomalies in the data patterns. And each time, I thought to myself that this work is complete, I always learn that the universe has a new twist and it teaches me that there are new ways to slice and dice that data than I have considered before. This could be as simple as an email newsletter broadcast with some content all the way to something as complex as displaying file system statistics in a meaningful way. But fundamentally all this slicing and dicing data ends up involving &amp;ldquo;statistics&amp;rdquo; in some shape or form. And that brings me to the book I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about today!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
