      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://DigitalRiver.blog/img/article/inspiration-banner.png&#34; alt=&#34;Inspire&#34; title=&#34;Inspiration&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This article was compiled from various blog sites that discussed the invention and details of the invention developed by Akash Manoj - a fifteen year old child prodigy over a three to five year period. The objective of this blog article is to describe his achievement and to provide a scientific detail around his invention (which I found lacking in other articles on-line). I felt that by providing the foundation and a road-map on how he devised the solution will encourage others to follow their inner creativity and dreams to achieve their desires and goals. This is my own understanding and interpretation based on the glimpses that was shared in various articles and by no means a first-hand account.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
