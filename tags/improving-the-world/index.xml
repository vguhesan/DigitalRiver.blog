      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, I sent an email to Harry&amp;rsquo;s Shave Club today! Being close to technology is a blessing and a curse sometimes. You start seeing ways to improve the user experience in everything you touch and you feel compelled to make the world a better place. So &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; - you&amp;rsquo;ve heard it. I am a member of Harry&amp;rsquo;s Shave Club.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I got tired of buying those expensive store brand razors that starts with a &amp;ldquo;G&amp;rdquo;. So I&amp;rsquo;ve tried both the DollarShaveClub and Harry&amp;rsquo;s. I&amp;rsquo;ve settled on Harry&amp;rsquo;s Shave Club. But that&amp;rsquo;s not the focus of this article. So today, as I was shaving this morning, it occurred to me that Harry&amp;rsquo;s can improve their customer experience by adding new functionality to their site and so as soon as I got out of the shower, I dashed to my computer before the idea skipped my mind and sat down to write this email to Harry&amp;rsquo;s. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that they see the value in adding this functionality to their website. I&amp;rsquo;m furthering my request for this feature by blogging about it. So let&amp;rsquo;s hope that it reaches someone&amp;rsquo;s ear at Harry&amp;rsquo;s and they see the value in my suggestion and they implement my request for helping Harry&amp;rsquo;s customers with a better user-experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
