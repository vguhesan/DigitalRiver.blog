I&amp;rsquo;ve dealt with system and monitoring solutions that puts out over a million IoT sensor data every few minutes. Streaming them, storing them, analyzing them and finding ways to slice and dice that data has always been interesting to me. And this has built my career the past 15 years. I am constantly trying to find new ways ways to show and represent the data in an UI dashboard and to try to find interesting anomalies in the data patterns. And each time, I thought to myself that this work is complete, I always learn that the universe has a new twist and it teaches me that there are new ways to slice and dice that data than I have considered before. This could be as simple as an email newsletter broadcast with some content all the way to something as complex as displaying file system statistics in a meaningful way. But fundamentally all this slicing and dicing data ends up involving &amp;ldquo;statistics&amp;rdquo; in some shape or form. And that brings me to the book I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about today!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
