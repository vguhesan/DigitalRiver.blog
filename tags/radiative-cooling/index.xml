      <description>&amp;lt;img src=&amp;#34;/img/2017/02/20170211_stp504.jpg&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;gt; The new film works by a process called radiative cooling. This takes advantage of that fact that Earth’s atmosphere allows certain wavelengths of heat-carrying infrared radiation to escape into space unimpeded. Convert unwanted heat into infrared of the correct wavelength, then, and you can dump it into the cosmos with no come back. &amp;hellip;their film, placed atop an average American house, would be enough to keep the internal temperature at 20°C on a day when it was 37°C outside.</description>
