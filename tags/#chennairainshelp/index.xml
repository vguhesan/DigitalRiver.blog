      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello All:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am writing today&amp;rsquo;s blog filled with tears and a sad heart to let the readers know that there are about 2 million people that are displaced in the city of Chennai, India today due to the recent massive floods. This flood is the worst seen in over 100 years in Chennai&amp;rsquo;s history. The last time this happened, Chennai (ancient city called Madrasapatinam) was not as densely populated as today (although we do not have actual numbers because census data is not available from 100 years ago). And to make matters worse the rainy season has just begun. It is anticipated that the rains may continue for another month or so.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
